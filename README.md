Quantum annealing in spin glass system

In recent years, the study of quantum annealing has been a topic of immense research interest due to its academic as well as practical importance in developing analog quantum computers. 
This technique is indeed in the core of the recent development of analog quantum computing by D-Wave quantum annealer. Some of the combinatorial optimization problems can be reduced to that of 
finding the ground state of interacting spin systems which have many local minima in the configuration space. An extensively studied NP-hard search problem of the ground state is that of the 
Sherrington-Kirkatrick (SK) model. One of the aims of this project is to find an algorithm for faster annealing compared to the existing one considering the SK spin glass model. In addition, we 
will also focus on solving real world optimization problems like car hiring, scheduling etc using quantum annealing approaches.
